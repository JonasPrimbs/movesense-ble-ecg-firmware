  HRData:
    required:
      - average
      - rrData
    properties:
      average:
        description: |
            Heart rate value that is averaged and filtered and presented in Hz.
            Invalid heart rate is presented by 0.0f.
        type: number
        format: float
        x-unit: Hz
        minimum: 0.0    # equals in HR 0 bpm
        maximum: 4.2    # equals in HR 252 bpm
      rrData:
        description: |
            RR-interval returns all the intervals in milliseconds. By default,
            single rr-interval value is returned after each heart beat. If for
            some reason the rr-interval becomes longer than 60 sec (60000ms),
            then max values and remainder are added to array, until the real
            interval time is met. For example, rr-interval becomes
            2min 12 sec 310ms, then returned rrData array is [60000,60000,12310].
        type: array
        minItems: 1
        maxItems: 60

          format: uint16
          x-unit: ms
          minimum: 240    # equals in HR 250 bpm
          maximum: 60000  # equals in HR 1 bpm

  TimestampFromStartup:
    description: Milliseconds since the startup (e.g. like reset or so).
