definitions:

  DetailedTime:
    required:
      - utcTime
      - relativeTime
      - tickRate
    properties:
      utcTime:
        description: UTC time of the device, number of microseconds since epoch 1.1.1970 (UTC).
        type: integer
        format: int64
      relativeTime:
        description: Local time of the device, milliseconds since device reset.
        type: integer
        format: uint32
        x-unit: millisecond
      tickRate:
        description: Tick rate of the device clock in ticks per second (Hz). This specifies the real resolution of the device clock.
