A Python interface and library for pc-ble-driver. This allows Python applications to interface with a Nordic Semiconductor IC (both nRF51 and nRF52 series) over a serial port to obtain access to the full serialized SoftDevice API. This package is compatible with 2.7 Python on both 32 and 64-bit architectures on Windows, Linux and macOS (OS X).
