## Overview

[Movesense sensor](https://www.movesense.com/developers/technology/#developers) is a programmable multi-purpose device comprising of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and thermometer together with optional heartrate/IBI (inter-beat interval) and intelligent gear ID APIs.  

Movesense APIs follow well-known REST principle and can be used both internally by the sensor app or externally via the iOS/Android libraries. The [API specification](https://bitbucket.org/suunto/movesense-device-lib/src/master/MovesenseCoreLib/resources/movesense-api/) is based on Swagger 2.0 syntax.

You can order Movesense sensors and Movesense Developer Kit on our online [shop](https://www.movesense.com/shop/).

Check also [Movesense mobile library](https://bitbucket.org/suunto/movesense-mobile-lib) for developing own Android and iOS applications to interact with the Movesense sensor.

## Setting up the development environment  

This section gives platform specific instructions on how to set up Movesense development environment. If you run into problems or need to install additional components
to your system to get the environment properly set up, please let us know by [submitting an issue](https://bitbucket.org/suunto/movesense-device-lib/issues/new).

There is an experimental installation procedure using Vagrant to set up an isolated environment for development ([check it out below](#markdown-header-automated-setup-on-all-operating-systems-using-vagrant)), or you can follow the manual installation instructions below.

### Manual setup on Windows
Install the following tools: 

* [GNU Toolchain for ARM Embedded 6-2017-q2](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
    * Remember to add it to your system path by ticking the checkbox during the last step of installation.

    * Download the file 
    * place ninja.exe file to C:/bin
    * Add C:/bin to system settings (PATH variable)
* [cmake >=3.6](https://cmake.org/download/)
    * Download cmake-3.8.2-win64-x64.zip
        * Extract the file
        * Add the binary directory (containing cmake.exe) to the system settings (PATH variable)

### Automated setup on all operating systems using Vagrant
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) provides an easy, reproducable environment
for setting up development environments. It provides an isolated environment with
all the dependencies set up without any version clashes or corner case bugs.

**Note: this method doesn't automatically install support for Movesense programming JIG.** Refer to [Linux installation steps](#markdown-header-manual-setup-on-linux) to enable JIG support.

To get up and running

1. Get [Vagrant for your platform](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Get [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (easiest way to run and manage VMs)
3. Clone this repository and run `vagrant up` - this will pull the ubuntu image and set up the environment necessary to develop Movesense software. This should take around 3 minutes.
4. Once the box is up, run `vagrant ssh` in the directory. You will be taken to the fully set up environment and ready to start developing. A great place to go next is *Example application build flow* below


## Example application build flow

```
#!python
> git clone git@bitbucket.org:suunto/movesense-device-lib.git
> cd movesense-device-lib
> mkdir myBuild
> cd myBuild
```  

To build a debug version of a selected sample application (hello_world app in this example):  

`> cmake -G Ninja -DMOVESENSE_CORE_LIBRARY=../MovesenseCoreLib/ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../MovesenseCoreLib/toolchain/gcc-nrf52.cmake ../samples/hello_world_app`  

To build a release version:  

```
> cmake -G Ninja -DMOVESENSE_CORE_LIBRARY=../MovesenseCoreLib/ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../MovesenseCoreLib/toolchain/gcc-nrf52.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../samples/hello_world_app  
> ninja
```  

**Note:** By default, the serial interface is enabled on Movesense sensor (see App.cpp file). Unless you need serial support (for programming JIG, for example), remember to keep it disabled to avoid excessive power consumption ([link to instructions](https://bitbucket.org/suunto/movesense-device-lib/src/master/MovesenseCoreLib/documentation/PowerOptimization.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default)).

### Updating sensor "over the air"

If you want to create OTA firmware update package, run command:  

`
ninja dfupkg
`

which places the OTA package named *movesense_dfu.zip* in the build folder. You can then use our [Android Sample App](https://bitbucket.org/suunto/movesense-mobile-lib) to update the firmware on your Movesense sensor over Bluetooth.

### Updating sensor with programming JIG

if you are using a *Movesense programming JIG* you can flash the resulting .hex-file (and the nRF52 SoftDevice) with:  

`
ninja flash
`

or you can use any other nRF52 compatible programming software such as *nRFGo Studio*. To acquire Movesense programming JIG, please contact us via [movesense.com](https://movesense.com).

### Removing manufacturing/settings data from the sensor
Command below updates the sensor firmware and additionally erases all settings in its memory. You should use it only if you want to replace default manufacturing/calibration data. Please don't use the command unless you know what you're doing!  

`
ninja flash_all
`
